#CPU load monitoring script: Monitor CPU usage and notify if it reaches a critical level.

# CPU Usage: Monitor the overall CPU usage to understand its workload. You can use tools like top, htop, or glances 
# to view the CPU usage in real-time. These tools provide a breakdown of CPU usage by individual processes and threads, 
# helping you identify resource-intensive applications.

# CPU Frequency and Scaling: Check the CPU frequency to determine if the processor is running at its maximum capability
#  or if it's being scaled down to conserve power. The cpufreq-info or lscpu commands can provide information on CPU 
#  frequency scaling.

# CPU Temperature: Monitor the CPU temperature to ensure it's operating within safe limits. Excessive heat can affect
#  performance and lead to thermal throttling. Use tools like sensors or lm-sensors to retrieve CPU temperature readings.

# CPU Model and Features: Identify the specific model and features of your CPU. The lscpu command provides detailed 
# information about the CPU architecture, vendor, cores, cache sizes, and more.

# CPU Load Average: Examine the system's load average, which represents the average number of processes waiting to 
# be executed over different time intervals. You can view the load average using the uptime command or by reading the /proc/loadavg file.

# Interrupts and Context Switches: Monitor the number of interrupts and context switches occurring on the CPU. Tools
#  like vmstat or sar can display these statistics, providing insights into system performance and potential bottlenecks.

# CPU Performance Counters: Utilize performance monitoring tools like perf to access CPU performance counters. These
#  counters provide low-level details on CPU events, such as cache misses, branch predictions, and instructions retired,
#  helping you analyze and optimize performance-critical code.

# CPU Affinity: Explore CPU affinity settings to control which CPUs are utilized by specific processes or threads.
# The taskset command allows you to assign or query CPU affinity for a given process.
